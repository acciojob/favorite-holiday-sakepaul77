	<h1>Goa</h1>
	<p>Goa, situated on the southwest coast of India, is renowned for its stunning coastline, which extends over 100 kilometers and boasts numerous golden sand beaches, crystal clear waters, and lush greenery. It is a harmonious blend of Indian and Portuguese cultures, evident from its unique architecture, cuisine, and lifestyle. Goa's history as a Portuguese colony prior to its integration into India in 1961 is still palpable, with many churches and old buildings displaying a distinct Portuguese style.</p>
